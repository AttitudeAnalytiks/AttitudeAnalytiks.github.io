## What we Did

**Tom**:  continued research and provided insight for the training of the classifers

**Kelly**: started to write a front end to the web app portion of the project and continued to write the nltk scripts for classifying & weighting words

**Logan**:  started writing our report

## Word of the Week
 
This week while writing the front end, we finally had to start using the  **Twitter Application Programming Interface**

Twitter provides a very rich Application Programming Interface (API).

This interface is entirely web-based, meaning that programs connect to resources over the Internet to query the system, access data, and even control their account.

You can read more about the Twitter API

### What to Do Next

connect everything! a front end is no good without a back end and a back end is worthless unless someone can use it! this will be the next major task to check off our list. 



 
 As always, Much to be done!

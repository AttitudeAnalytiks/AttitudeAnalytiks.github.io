Our Project:
Sentiment analysis is an active and growing field with uses that include academic research and business marketing. The goal of our project is to provide users of our finished product with an implementation of sentiment analysis performed on historical or real-time data collected from various social media and news outlet sources. We will develop a web based application to measure and track the collective attitude and sentiment of a representative Internet population on a particular topic using multiple data sources, such as Twitter, online newspapers and Google search results. Our sentiment analysis engine will be implemented using Python and NLTK with results of the analysis being visually presented graphically and dynamically using HTML, JavaScript, Ajax and jQuery.

title: Weekly Update 2
---

This week, as team, we continued to do more **research**. Luckily, this time it involved some "demo-ing" and programming with NLTK & Python and all it's capabilities. Using NLTK will make performing sentiment analysis much "easier" than if we had to write all the functions available from scratch. It provides a strong starting platform for us.

## What we Did

**Tom: ** brushed up on Python skills & finally set up GitHub account!

**Kelly: ** wrote a simple pre-processing script for Tweets, pulling out "stop words" and putting into a feature vector and started to play around with different classifier demos available from the NLTK Cookbook

**Logan: **  started writing our report & read more papers about opinion mining and sentiment analysis 

## Word of the Week
 Last week, on our list of tasks to do next, we mentioned picking a ** Classifier **.  Machine learning has various methods to classify data. Classifiers may or may not need training data. Fortunately for us, NLTK defines several classifier classes:  ConditionalExponentialClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, MaxentClassifier, NaiveBayesClassifier, WekaClassifier. This potentially adds another "research element" to our project, which classifier is the most accurate and efficient.

### What to Do Next

The next couple weeks our tasks will be writing the scripts to implement these different classifiers using NLTK & Python, gathering the data we need from Twitter, and visualizing the results.

Dr. Joyce mentioned to us today that he would love to see the "Future Plans" from the last 5 or so years analyzed to see how things have changed. This is definitely on our to-do list and adds a new and relevant angle to our project!

 
 As always, Much to be done!
